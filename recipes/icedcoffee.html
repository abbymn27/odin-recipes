    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h3>Growing up, spending summers stuck at home was made more bearable by the addition of caffeine. I've naturally been addicted ever since; peaking my senior year of high school with a medium black cold brew from Dunkin' 3 times a day to fuel my extracurriculars. But now I've given in to cream and sugar, happily adding the flavors that make an addiction worth having. Its a simple way to make me happy.</h3>
