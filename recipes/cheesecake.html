    <h1>New York Cheesecake</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
        <h3><p>A classic treat: smooth creamy flavors complemented by a crisp honey graham cracker crust. My <em>secret</em> ingredient? I sprinkle cinnamon sugar over the graham cracker crust. I recomend taking <strong>all</strong> of your ingredients out before getting started. Every ingredient in this recipe benefits from sitting out and coming to room temperature. Except for the sour cream, but that doesn't come into play until the very end of the recipe after the "cake" has already baked. Don't forget that this cake has to cool for at least 8 hours, so plan your baking accordingly. This recipe can also easily become gluten friendly by substituting a gluten freem graham cracker or plain cookie base in the same ammounts as the recipe lists. Makes one 9-inch cake.</p></h2>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
         <ul>
             <p><li>1.5 Cups Graham Cracker Crumbs (or prefered alternative</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
         <ol>

            <li>Mix together the graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and butter in a bowl until evenly mositened. <em>If crushing your own, I'd recomend using a blender, starting with the dry ingredients, and then pouring in the butter and blending again afterwards</em> Press into the bottom of an assembled 9-inch springform pan, going aprox. a 1/2 inch up the sides.</li>
            <li>In a seperate, clean, large bowl, mix together the cream cheese with the sugar until smooth. Blend in the eggs, 1 table spoon of vanilla, and cream of tartar. Pour over the crust.</li>
            <li>Bake in a preheated oven for 50 minutes. Allow to cool on counter for 5 minuets or until top has stopped depressing.</li>
            <li>While waiting, mix together the sour cream, vanilla, and sugar until smooth. Pour over the top of the cake, trying not to go over the edge and down the sides of the cake.</li>
            <li>Return to oven for another 5 minutes and then allow to cool in pan to room temperature. Refrigerate for at least 8 hours before serving.</li>
